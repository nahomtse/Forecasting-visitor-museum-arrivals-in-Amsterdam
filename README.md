Tourism has an important role for the economy of the Netherlands. Amsterdam plays a crucial part for the tourism demand in the Netherlands. In order to get better insights of tourism, it is essential to conduct more research in forecasting tourism. Lots of research has been conducted about forecasting tourism demand to a certain country or city. However, there little  attention has been paid in research about tourist behavior at destination. For the improvement of the mobility of a more and more dense Amsterdam, it is important to forecast tourist arrivals with a high accuracy. Transportation operators can create better transportation network throughout Amsterdam and create more transportation hubs, such as bus stops or shared E-bike places, at place where the tourist arrivals in very high. The aim of this study is to generate the best forecast model of tourist arrivals for specific point of interests (POI’s) using different frequency data by evaluating different time series models and neutral network models. The frequency rate of visitors arrivals that has been used are daily, weekly and monthly. Multiple models such as Naïve, SES, HWES, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA and LSTM are compared for different frequency rate of visitors arrivals and POI’s. The results suggest that highly accurate forecast can be best done by SARIMA model or LSTM model with a monthly frequency rate. Future research is needed to improve accuracy on weekly and daily frequency visitor arrival rate.
